# Network-Optimization

In this project, we are going to implement a network routing protocol using the methods of Dijkstra, Kruskal and BFS algorithms with max-heap and gragh data structures.

The protocol is designed for varies network optimization problems, especially at the background of data optimization scenario.

This is a course project of `CSCE 629 Analisis of Algorithms`.
